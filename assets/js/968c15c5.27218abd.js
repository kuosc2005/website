It provides a space where students can learn about different subjects, ranging from various computer technologies to even university curricula. However, Open School goes beyond just offering educational resources but also encourages students to contribute their own knowledge and create content to share with others. By having students engage in this give-and-take process of education, Open School aims to make learning more collaborative, accessible, and student-driven. The educational resources are available at the youtube channel Kathmandu University Open Source Community (KUOSC).","sidebar":"open-school"}}}')}}]);
