Localization refers to the process of tailoring content to suit the specific
linguistic, cultural, and other requirements of a targeted audience.  
Since 2013, Kathmandu University Open Source Community
[[KUOSC](https://kuosc.org.np/)] has been actively organizing Localization
events. These events are focused on educating individuals about the
significance of Localization and its impact on everyday life.

## Motive

- **Improve Accessibility**: We intend on making open-source
  projects more user-friendly and accessible for non-English speakers.
- **Foster Community Engagement**: We work on fostering community engagement by
  motivating those who are new into the open-source community by congratulating
  them with themed prizes/merch for being the top contributors of each localization
  event.
- **Enhance Global Collaboration**: Working with internationally recognized 
  institutions has enhanced the collaboration on a global scale.
- **Improve Software Usability**: We intend on improving software's usability by
  localizing the User Interface (UI) along with the documentation of the designated
  software.

## Achievements

Some of the achievements conquered by our _localization_ events:

- **LibreOffice**: In collaboration with other open-source communities of Nepal
  we worked on localizing LibreOffice, a widely used open-source document creation
  suite.

- **VLC Media Player**: KUOSC's localization of VLC media player, made the program
  more user-friendly.

- **Ubuntu Operating System**: We also contributed on making Ubuntu, a
  user-friendly GNU/Linux distro, accessible to Nepali users by translating
  the interface.

- **Firefox Web Browser**: KUOSC's localization efforts ensured comfortable and
  efficient web browsing for Nepali users by translating the Firefox interface.

- **Bahmini Educational Software**: KUOSC localized Bahmini, hospital management
  platform, enhancing user experiences for medical officials, making it easier
  for navigativing around the software.
