description: An insight on Localization and it's impact.
---

Localization refers to the process of tailoring/adapting content to suit the specific
linguistic, cultural, and other requirements of a targeted audience.  
Since 2013, Kathmandu University Open Source Community
([KUOSC](https://kuosc.org.np/)) has been actively organizing Localization
events. These events are focused on educating individuals about the significance
of localization and its impact on everyday life.

## Motive

- **Improve Accessibility**: We intend on making open-source projects more
  user-friendly and accessible for non-English speakers.
- **Foster Community Engagement**: We work on fostering community engagement by
  motivating those who are new into the open-source community by congratulating
  them with themed prizes/merch for being the top contributors of each
  localization event.
- **Enhance Global Collaboration**: Working with internationally recognized
  institutions has enhanced the collaboration on a global scale.
- **Improve Software Usability**: We intend on improving software's usability by
  localizing the User Interface (UI) along with the documentation of the
  designated software.

## Achievements
We have contributed on localization of softwares like:
- LibreOffice

- VLC Media Player

- Ubuntu Operating System

- Firefox Web Browser

- Bahmini
