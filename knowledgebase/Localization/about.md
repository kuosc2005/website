description: An insight on Localization and it's impact.
---

Software localization is the process of adopting software for a specific language,region,and culture. It involves more than just translation; it ensures that the software feels natural to users in their local context.   

Since 2013, Kathmandu University Open Source Community
([KUOSC](https://kuosc.org.np/)) has been actively participating in and organizing Localization
events. These events are focused on educating individuals about the significance
of localization and its impact on everyday life.

## Motive

- **Improve Accessibility**: We intend on making open-source projects more
  user-friendly and accessible for non-English speakers.
  
- **Foster Community Engagement**: We work on fostering community engagement by
  motivating those who are new into the open-source community by congratulating
  them with themed prizes/merch for being the top contributors of each
  localization event.
  
- **Enhance Global Collaboration**: Working with internationally recognized
  institutions has enhanced the collaboration on a global scale.
  
- **Improve Software Usability**: We intend on improving software's usability by
  localizing the User Interface (UI) along with the documentation of the
  designated software.

## Achievements
KUOSC has made significant contributions to the localization efforts of various prominent software projects, spanning across diverse domains. Here are some notable achievements:

- **Bahmni**:
KUOSC took the initiative to organize and lead the Bahmni localization sprint independently. Bahmni, an open-source healthcare platform, received dedicated contribution from KUOSC, resulting in comprehensive localization efforts tailored to the specific needs of healthcare professionals and patients in rural Nepali community.

- **LibreOffice**: 
KUOSC played a pivotal role in the LibreOffice localization sprint, which was initiated by The Document Foundation (TDF). Collaborating with TDF, BOSC, NOSK, and KUOSC, the sprint aimed to enhance the accessibility of LibreOffice across different linguistic communities. As one of the organizers, Kuosc facilitated the coordination of efforts and ensured effective communication among contributors. This initiative led to the expansion of LibreOffice's language support and improved user experience for non-English-speaking users worldwide.

- **VLC Media Player**:
KUOSC has contributed to the localization of VLC Media Player, a versatile and widely used multimedia player.

- **Ubuntu Operating System**:
KUOSC has participated in the nepali localization efforts of the Ubuntu operating system, one of the most popular Linux distributions globally.

- **Firefox Web Browser**:
KUOSC has been involved in localizing the Firefox web browser, an open-source project developed by Mozilla. By translating the browser interface, add-ons, and support materials, KUOSC has contributed to Firefox's mission of providing a secure and customizable browsing experience to users worldwide.
