# About

E-library or electronic library is an ambitious and innovative project launched by Help Nepal Network to offer computer facilities for the benefit of students and communities in all 75 districts of the country. KUOSC joined forces with this project in 2014. In 2014, the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (DoCSE) entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Help Nepal Network. The MoU outlines that the technical assistantship for the E-Library Project will be carried out by students from DoCSE, Kathmandu University (KU).

The Project aims to install low-cost, high-impact computer facilities in schools and rural centers. Based on an innovative model that uses a single networked server to run multiple computer stations, the Help Nepal e-library can be deployed at one-fourth the cost of a traditional computer lab. The computers run on a Linux platform that is secure, stable and require low-maintenance. Moreover, the use of open source software makes future upgrades free of cost.

## Evolution and Inception

The HeNN E-library Project's roots trace back to 2007 when the FOSS community of the Institute of Engineering (IOE) deployed E-libraries in Thakalmath and Dang Deukhuri. Over the years, the project expanded, resulting in the deployment of 35 E-Libraries by 2015.

## Deployment History

E-Libraries have been established in various districts, including Surkhet, Salyan, Bardiya, Kailali, Pyuthan, Gulmi, Sindhupalchwok, Sinduoalchowk, Sunsari, Morang, Udayapur, Saptari, Kavre, Parbat, Kaski, Solukhumbu, Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Rautahat.

## Establishment of ELibrary

The establishment of E-Libraries encompasses a comprehensive process that includes several key stages.

1. Feasibility analysis and site review following the receipt of proposals.
2. The deployment phase encompasses both setup and training activities.
   - A training program is conducted to equip teachers with the necessary skills, spanning from establishing LAN cable connections to troubleshooting on the Edubuntu platform.
3. Continuous monitoring is an integral part of the process, carried out two times annually over a span of 2 years to ensure sustained effectiveness.
4. LTSP Trainings, where KUOSC volunteers receive specialized training in the Linux Terminal Server Project (LTSP), enhancing their ability to effectively contribute to the project's success.

## Impact and Achievements

The impact of the HeNN E-Library Project has been profound:

- E-Libraries established in 35 districts
- Used by students from grades 5-10
- Over 25 students benefit from each class, totaling 5000+ daily users
- Bridging the technology gap and providing equitable access to resources
