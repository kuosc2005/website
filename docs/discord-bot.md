## About this Project

This Discord bot project aims to create a well-organized and efficient server for various communities. 

## Structure of the Server

The server will be organized into different categories:

1. **Communities**: Each community will have a separate category, governed by community coordinators, who possess full access rights to their respective categories. Every category of the communities need to be private, and members of the respective communities can have limited access to the category. Each community will have at least the following channels:
    - Announcement
    - Forum-Discussion
    - General
    - Resources
    - Help
    - Voice Channel
2. **On-boarding**: Upon arrival of a new member in the Discord Server, the bot should welcome new members and provide a comprehensive guide to the server, including rules and responsibilities, as well as a walk-through of the server. There will be an `on-boarding` category that hosts the role assignment and KUCC membership channels. The channels in this category include:
    - **Welcome:** A welcoming message for everyone who joins the server.
    - **Roles Assignment:** A space for students to choose their CE/CS/BIT roles.
    - **KUCC Membership:** Instructions on how to become a general member of Kathmandu University Computer Club are provided here. Members can create a ticket to get the role of KUCC Member.
    - **Community Assignment:** Allow KUCC members to select from various communities if they wish to participate.
3. **KUCC Support**: This category will only be visible to KUCC members and will include general channels. The 'Open Ticket' channel will allow members to open a private ticket that is visible only to respective community coordinators and admins.
4. **Executive Zone**: A separate category for executives.
5. **General**: A category for general discussions.
6. **KUOSC**: A category dedicated to the Kathmandu University Open Source Community.

Each category aims to streamline the server's operations, ensuring that every member can find the resources and help they need.
