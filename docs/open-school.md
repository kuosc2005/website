# Open School

## About the Initiative

OpenSchool is an initiative aimed at creating an active community centered around peer-to-peer learning and knowledge sharing among students. Through OpenSchool, students have the opportunity to create educational videos and tutorials covering a wide range of subjects and topics. These contributions are then shared within the community, allowing them to learn from the collective knowledge and insights of their fellow students.

The ultimate goal of this initiative is to empower students to shape their own learning journeys, contribute to the growth of knowledge, and cultivate a space for learners to become teachers and teachers to become learners.
