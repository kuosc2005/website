# KUCC Website

## About this project

The Kathmandu University Computer Club (KUCC) website serves as the main platform for the KUCC. It provides comprehensive information about the club, including its activities, how to apply for membership, and the journals it publishes.

## Plans and Features

- Integrate the website with the study and resource section of cscedrive (https://cscedrive.chandanmahato.com.np/). This will improve accessibility to study materials and resources.

- Foster relationships and recognition among KUCC members and alumni, enhancing a sense of community and collaboration.

- Establish a platform where members can log in using their student accounts and manage their profiles. This includes their bios, tech stack, semester projects, and interests.

- Ensure everyone is informed about the ongoing research and various labs in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering.

- Showcase current student projects through a semester project listing.

## **Tech Stack:**

The website is built using Next.js, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS.
