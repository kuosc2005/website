# OpenSchool

OpenSchool is an initiative aimed at creating an active community centered around peer-to-peer learning and knowledge sharing among students. It provides a space where students can learn about different subjects, ranging from various computer technologies to even university curricula. However, OpenSchool goes beyond just offering educational resources but also encourages students to contribute their own knowledge and create content to share with others. By having students engage in this give-and-take process of education, OpenSchool aims to make learning more collaborative, accessible, and student-driven. The educational resources are available at the youtube channel [Kathmandu University Open Source Community (KUOSC)](https://www.youtube.com/@kuosc).

## Why OpenSchool?

OpenSchool was created to address the need for a more accessible, engaging, and student-driven approach to education. Instead of the traditional learning models, which often involve a one-way flow of information from instructors to students, OpenSchool wants students to be both learners and instructors. Students can learn subjects they are interested in, as well as create and provide materials on topics they have expertise in. Ultimately, the initiative was born out of a belief that education should be a dynamic and interactive exchange, where students are not just passive learners but also active contributors to the collective understanding of various subjects.

## Target Audience

OpenSchool's target audience is every student from Nepal, regardless of their location or how remote it may be. Regardless of any other factors, the content on OpenSchool is tailored for Nepali people, with the primary language of the videos being Nepali. Whether students are in urban areas or rural villages, OpenSchool aims to provide accessible educational resources to all.

## How does OpenSchool work?

Students create videos teaching subjects or topics they are knowledgeable about. These student-made videos are then hosted on a platform accessible to everyone. Any student can watch videos on topics they want to learn, made by their peers who have expertise in those areas. They are free to comment, ask questions, and give feedback on the videos.
